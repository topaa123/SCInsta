# Building from source
### Prerequisites

- [cyan](https://github.com/asdfzxcvbn/pyzule-rw?tab=readme-ov-file#install-instructions) **\*only required for sideloading**

### Setup
1. Install iOS 14.5 frameworks for theos
   1. [Click to download iOS SDKs](https://github.com/xybp888/iOS-SDKs/archive/refs/heads/master.zip)
   2. Unzip, then copy the `iPhoneOS14.5.sdk` folder into `~/theos/sdks`

3. **For sideloading**: Download a decrypted Instagram IPA from a trusted source, making sure to rename it to `com.burbn.instagram.ipa`.

# Support the project
SCInsta takes a lot of time to develop, as the Instagram app is ever-changing and difficult to keep up with. Additionally, I'm still a student which doesn't leave me much time to work on this tweak.

If you'd like to support my work, you can donate to my [ko-fi page](https://ko-fi.com/socuul)!\
There's many other ways to support this project however, by simply sharing a link to this tweak with others who would like it!

Seeing people use this tweak is what keeps me motivated to keep working on it ‚ù§Ô∏è
